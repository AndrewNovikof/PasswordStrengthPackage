This package provides a validator that ensures strong passwords in Laravel 4 and 5 applications. It is influenced  a lot by [PasswordStrengthBundle for Symfony 2](https://github.com/jbafford/PasswordStrengthBundle).

It is out now for a while and since there were no complaints it very likely fulfills its purpose.

The provided validations include:

- check if input contains alphabetic characters
- check if input contains numeric characters
- check if input contains mixed case characters
- check if input contains symbols
